# SMoRe (***S***imple ***M***arkd***o***wn ***R***end***e***ring)
SMoRe is a simple package that converts Markdown text to an ANSI output. It was created after realizing [Glamour](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour) outputted too many characters to send in a Discord message. SMoRe will only support the bare necessities.
